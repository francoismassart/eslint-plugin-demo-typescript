# Writing a custom ESLint plugin with TypeScript code

This repo is based on the "[Writing a custom ESLint plugin with Typescript](https://thesonofthomp.medium.com/writing-a-custom-eslint-plugin-with-typescript-08d0e01726d2)" Medium article written by [Adam Thompson
](https://github.com/thesonofthomp).

## Why this repo?

I was expecting to find a link to a repo with the full code explained in Adam's article but I could not find it.

It will be a quick way to browse the full code on its own and possibly to enhance it by fixing issues.
